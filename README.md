## About NclusterBox

NclusterBox is an algorithm that summarizes n-way Boolean and fuzzy tensors using sub-tensors, represented as patterns. It identifies significant patterns within the data based on their density and area, providing insights into the underlying structure and relationships within the tensor.

## Application Features

- **Interactive Scatter Plot:** Visualize patterns as data points in a 2D scatter plot. 
    - Size of data points represents the pattern size.
    - Color of data points represents the pattern density.
    - Zoom and pan to explore different regions of the visualization.
    - Tooltips display detailed information about each pattern.
    - Highlight data points and their connections to visualize intersections between patterns.
- **RSS Evolution Graph:** Analyze the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) evolution of the model as the number of patterns increases.
    - Identify potential elbows in the graph to determine an optimal number of patterns for summarizing the tensor.
    - Truncate the model by selecting a specific number of patterns.
- **Pattern Summary View:** Explore detailed information about individual patterns.
    - View the dimensions, density, and size of the pattern.
    - Inspect the specific values of each dimension.
